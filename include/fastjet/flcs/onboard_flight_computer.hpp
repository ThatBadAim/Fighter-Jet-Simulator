/**
 * @brief On-Board Flight Computer (OFC) — autonomous pilot-safety override systems.
 *
 * Implements two independent, real-world inspired safety systems:
 *
 *  1. GLOC Auto-Recovery (G-induced Loss Of Consciousness)
 *     Monitors the pilot's G-exposure with a simplified Franks/Goodwin physiological
 *     model. When exposure accumulates past the incapacitation threshold the FLCS takes
 *     autonomous control (wings-level + gentle climb) until the pilot regains
 *     full authority.  Visual blackout fraction is exposed for screen-space rendering.
 *
 *  2. Auto-GCAS (Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System)
 *     Mirrors the NASA/AFRL/Lockheed system that has saved 11+ F-16 pilots since 2014.
 *     Every tick the kinematic pull-out altitude required at the recovery G this
 *     airframe can actually pull right now (nominal 5 G, less when slow) — budgeted
 *     for the G onset lag and for the extra altitude a bank angle will cost while
 *     rolling wings level — is compared to the actual terrain clearance.  Engagement is judged
 *     purely on that predicted margin, not on how steep the current dive happens to
 *     be, so a shallow-but-low descent is caught exactly as reliably as a steep one.
 *     A hard 30 ft AGL deck is enforced on top of that as an unconditional backstop:
 *     no kinematic model is trusted blindly, so any descent through the deck forces
 *     recovery regardless of what the margin calculation says.  Recovery is a
 *     two-phase manoeuvre — roll wings-level first, then pull at the nominal
 *     recovery G, escalating smoothly toward a capped ceiling only if the height left
 *     or time-to-impact becomes critical (it never demands the airframe's full G
 *     limit — both are scaled to the configured airframe — since an
 *     unrealistic max-G pull risks GLOC or structural overstress and defeats the
 *     point of a *safety* system) — and it commands the throttle alongside the
 *     stick: idle while still banking into wings-level (bleeds off the dive instead
 *     of accelerating into the ground — unless the jet is too slow to spare the
 *     energy), then full power once pulling out (arrests
 *     the sink rate and prevents the recovery itself from bleeding into a stall).
 *     The commanded pull is faded out between 135 and 165 deg of bank (see
 *     bank_pull_scale), because only the cos(bank) share of the lift vector opposes
 *     the descent — pulling while
 *     inverted drives the nose into the terrain.  A deliberate pilot stick input
 *     hands control back once the jet is out of immediate danger.
 *
 *  3. Tumble / Spin Auto-Recovery
 *     Detects a departure (deep stall, flat spin, violent tumble) and applies
 *     anti-spin rudder, roll damping and a stall-breaking pitch command.
 *
 * Authority order is fixed: departure recovery stands Auto-GCAS down before it
 * engages (a pull-out margin means nothing in a spin), but an Auto-GCAS recovery
 * already under way keeps the pitch and roll axes, with the anti-spin rudder still
 * applied underneath it.  Every pilot-intent test reads the *raw* inceptor
 * positions, never the OFC's own output.
 *
 * Zero dynamic heap allocation.  Thread-safe if external synchronisation is provided.

     * Only the cos(bank) share of the lift vector opposes the descent, so past 90 deg
     * a nose-up pull has a component driving the nose *toward* the terrain.  Held
     * while the jet is inverted, that is exactly how an automatic recovery turns into
     * a crash, so the pull is faded out and the roll is allowed to finish first.
     *
     * The fade deliberately starts well past 90 deg rather than at the geometric
     * crossover.  Closed-loop runs against the 6-DoF model show that between roughly
     * 90 and 135 deg of bank the pull is still clearly worth commanding: the pitch
     * loop is slow to build alpha, so pre-loading it while the wings are coming level
     * buys more clearance than the brief downward component costs — gating at 90 deg
     * instead gave up ~10 m of terrain clearance across that band.  Past ~165 deg the
     * balance inverts sharply and the pull becomes the dominant hazard; gating there
     * gains 15-20 m in the inverted split-S case and turns one low-speed inverted
     * scenario from a ground impact into a recovery.
     *
     * Note this is a fade between two angles, not a proportional cos(bank) scaling:
     * scaling the command would make the achieved vertical acceleration fall off as
     * cos^2 and needlessly weaken the recovery at moderate bank.
